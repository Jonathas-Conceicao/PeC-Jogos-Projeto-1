	getting his beloved wife back, the Knight left the orb hidden within his castle, and just the braver
	knight with the purest hart could found it.  

	After hearing the story Alanis falls asleep and finds herself in a strange dream,

	- we should have a room of tropheus, where there are _paints_ with images of others games that the group made  
	- the initial screen shows how deep is the game save  
	- and some aspects about the __player__  
	- the facts that she is a warrior facilitate the drawning
