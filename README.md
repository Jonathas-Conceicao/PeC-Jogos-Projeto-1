# PeC-Jogos-Projeto-1  
This is our repository for our Digital Games Course.

## The game

The game we are developing is called **Souls of Alanis**, in this README you will find some information about it.  

The [Storyboard](StoryBoard.md) has most of the games aspects and features that we propose to implement.  

The [Hero's Journey](The_Monomyth.md) has some quick notes about the story structure we followed for the game's Lore.  

Some of our tests and tech demos can be found on the [projects](projects/) folder.  

Through the rest of the file we have some weekly-updated information about the current state of the project.
