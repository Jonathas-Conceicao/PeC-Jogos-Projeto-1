## Story Board Notes
### Introduction
**Souls of Alanis** is a 2D platform _rouguelike_ with medieval thematic. The player takes control of Alanis, a cat-warrior whom's soul always reincarnates in a new body without the blessing of eternal rest. To be able to finally be free, Alanis must beat the Dungeon and defeat the evil wizard who casted this curse upon her.

Since its a _rouguelike_ the game is heavily focused in the combat. The dungeon is divided between several stages, each of differ by its theme, enemies, traps that are randomly distributed along the stage. Through each stage of the dungeon the player will have to face different bosses in order to proceed.
