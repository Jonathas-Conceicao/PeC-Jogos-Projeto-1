# Possible future aspects to implement

### To-Draw
Most of the art currently being used was not made by us because of the lack of time.  
So this is the list of art we need, and are curretly using from others sources:  
  - a cat to be Alanis  
  - warrior Alanis: The main player (current is from RL)  
Fell free to add your own request, or to just add art you are using, from external sources, and someone could draw.  

### On the combat
  - the player have more than one type of atack, that changes based on the weapon in use  

### On the atributes
  - change scale of HP point, based on future games tests
